    Introduction
</h1>
<p class="intro-1">
    Themes that are included in this research are conflict and refugees, which are common in most of the societies.<br><br> These themes were selected because they reflect the society of Kurdistan and lead people to leave the country.<br><br> The research question about these themes is, “Does the decrease of conflicts between parties in society decrease<br><br> the expansion of refugees?” The reason behind choosing refugees is people of Kurdistan leave the country because of<br><br> lack of unity between the parties of society. This resulted in people not getting their rights. The chosen hypothesis for<br><br> this research is: If the conflicts between parties in society decrease, then the number of refugees in Kurdistan decrease.<br><br> Kurds in order to live peacefully and having their rights ensured, parties of society should unite for the sake of Kurds to<br><br> protect Kurds rights, with this the rate of refugees decrease.

<h1 class="lr">Literature Review</h1>
<p class="lr_1">       The first source for this research is a book, “The State of The World’s Refugees 1993”<br><br> by Sodako Ogato, published in 1993. The book gives an overview of how bad political roots generate refugees.<br><br> The author states that the authorities in the Kurdistan region and their foreign partners should take these protests seriously.<br><br> He further demonstrates the risks if authorities abandon the protests. This article supports the research question by addressing<br><br> the research topic about refugees and their suffer from the government. Though this article is interesting, the age of the book is old.<br><br> For example, the book is published in 1993. In addition, it includes some facts that are not related to the present day.<br><br><br> 
    The second source is a journal, “Grand Challenge: Refugees and Conflict” by Jane Freedman, published in 2019.<br><br> The journal gives an overview of refugees and their conflicts. The author states that whilst the number of people forced <br><br>to move from their homes increases, the responses to displacement both national and international are still not sufficient to offer<br><br> protection and security to refugees. He further demonstrates that how they are forced to migrate. This article is chosen because it<br><br> connects with the research topic about refugees and conflicts that lead to refuge. Though this article is interesting, it doesn’t address<br><br> all research question. For example, it doesn’t talk about refugees in Kurdistan. Also, the research doesn’t talk about parties conflicts.<br><br><br>

     The third source for this research is a website, “Simmering Frustration and a Demand for Change:<br><br> Public Service Protest in the Kurdistan Region” by Winthrop Rodgers, published in 2021.<br><br> The article gives a brief overview of why people in Kurdistan protesting against Government and what these protests all about?<br><br> The author states that these protests point to simmering dissatisfaction with governance in the KRI across broad swathes of the population.<br><br> He further demonstrates do these protests have impact?<br><br> This article is chosen because it connects to the research topic about refugees and parties conflicts.<br><br> Though this article is interesting, it doesn’t answer my research question. For example, it only focuses on people’ refugees and its cause.<br><br> Also, it doesn’t talk about refugees.
